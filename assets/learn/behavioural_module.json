        "Knowing more about your managing condition can help you feel more in control.",
        "Can you get a reaction from kissing?",
        "Yes, it is possible. If a person has eaten your allergen within about the past 4 hours they can have traces of your allergen in their saliva, and you can come in contact with this through sharing utensils like water bottles, straws, glasses, cutlery ect and yes, kissing. You might have heard a phrase about not to \u2018kiss and tell\u2019, but with allergies you should \u2018tell, then kiss\u2019! If you have a regular boyfriend or girlfriend, some sensible things you could do would be to ask them not to eat your allergen around you, and for a few hours before you meet up. Eating food without your allergen and brushing their teeth before meeting up could also help. This might be more difficult in a situation that is unplanned, like at a disco! Thinking about risk assessment again, it\u2019s just important to remember that if you have kissed someone without knowing if they have eaten your allergen, and you feel any symptoms of an allergic reaction, then you should just treat it as per your allergy action plan. Another reason that you need to have your adrenaline pens and antihistamine with you always, even if you\u2019re not planning on eating, like when going out to a disco."

      "content": [
        "Alcohol is a known co-factor (see section on co-factors) which makes it more likely to have a more severe allergic reaction if you have your allergen. However, it also can affect your allergies in other ways, which are important to be aware of.",
        "Drinking alcohol affects your ability to think clearly. So, you might normally be really careful with everything you eat, but after drinking alcohol are less able to judge a situation. Also, alcohol can reduce your blood sugar making you feel hungry, and more likely to want to eat. Your allergen may actually be in your drink (see section on your allergen). If you do have an allergic reaction, being confused and drowsy can be a symptom of anaphylaxis. But people may assume that the drowsiness and confusion are due to being drunk, and this can mean that your allergic reaction doesn\u2019t get noticed as easy. It will also mean that you are less able to treat yourself or to get others to help you.",
        "So what can I do if I do decide to drink alcohol?",
        "The legal age for drinking alcohol in Ireland is 18 years. If you do decide to drink alcohol at some point, you should consider these tips to help reduce your allergy-related risks;",
        "When ordering a drink at a bar, you should tell staff about your allergy and ask if the drink has your allergen. If it is very loud and noisy and you can\u2019t have a conversation with staff, you should choose a drink that you know (not having it for the first time) or a pre-packaged drink (like a bottle) that you can read the ingredients list on. If you\u2019ve already been drinking and you\u2019re offered a drink and you\u2019re not sure if it is safe for you, you should politely say no thanks, and instead have a drink you\u2019re sure of, as your mind may not be totally clear to decide if it is safe or not. You could make a note of the name of the drink in your phone and look it up the next day so you know for the future.",
        "Be very careful of cocktails as even if the drink you ordered doesn\u2019t contain your allergen, there can be cross contact from cocktail shakers/ blenders and preparing surfaces. You should tell the bartender about your allergies and ask them to clean the surfaces and equipment. If its too loud/ busy, you should pick a different drink.",
        "Eat plenty before you start drinking, so you won\u2019t be as tempted later to have food you may be unsure of. You could also have some safe snacks with you (in your bag or coat pocket) in case you are hungry later.",
        "You definitely need your adrenaline pens with you! Even if you don\u2019t plan on eating, you may do so if you\u2019re drunk, and a drink may contain your allergen or cross contact may happen.",
        "Buddy up! Make sure a friend with you knows all about your allergies, signs of a reaction, where you have your adrenaline pens and what to do. It\u2019s also a good idea to put your parents\u2019 numbers in your friends phones contacts \u2013 in case your phone is locked and your friend doesn\u2019t know your pin/ your phone has facial recognition.",
        "Can I get anaphylaxis from touching or smelling my food allergen?",
        "So a serious allergic reaction, or anaphylaxis, can only happen when you ingest your allergen (like if you eat it, or if it gets into your mouth from cross contact, eg like a contaminated cup). Researchers have done studies that have shown that people who are allergic can hold their allergen in their hand and not have a serious allergic reaction, although they may get mild local skin symptoms like itchiness or a rash on their hand. You shouldn\u2019t handle your allergen on purpose though, due to the risk of transferring it to your mouth as we explain below.",
        "Sometimes people worry about getting a serious allergic reaction through their breathing if they can smell their allergen in the air, particularly on airplanes. In the past, we didn\u2019t know for sure if that could happen, and so people were advised to be careful. In recent years, researchers have studied this, and we now know that this is not a risk for most allergens. The reason for this is that it is the protein in a food that people are allergic to, and protein particles are heavy, and so don\u2019t carry in the air. Food allergens are therefore not airborne. The only exception is fish/ shellfish, while it is being cooked, and so if you have a fish/ shellfish allergy, you shouldn\u2019t be in the kitchen when someone is cooking fish. Researchers have tested this by having food allergic people sit beside their allergen in a room, and showing that they don\u2019t get allergic reactions. They also have shown that on airplanes, the ventilation systems don\u2019t pose any extra risk, as the filter size would catch any protein particles anyway.",
        "So the risk with being around your food allergen is not the touching or smelling itself, but the chance that if it\u2019s in your environment and other people are handling your allergen, surfaces could become contaminated with it, and if you then touch those surfaces and put your hand to your mouth, you could have a reaction in that way (although still less likely than if you ate it accidentally!). The reality is that as you go through life, other people will have your allergen around you, and there isn\u2019t a lot you can do to control that.",
        "What you can control is yourself, so",
        "Be alert",
        "Clean down surfaces with detergent wipes or soap and water if they\u2019ve been in contact with your allergen (which will remove the allergen protein)",
        "Wash your hands regularly using soap and water. Wet cleansing wipes are next best. Water on its\u2019 own doesn\u2019t work, and hand sanitiser will also not remove the allergen protein!).",
        "Be careful not to put your hands in your mouth if your allergen is around you (like biting your nails for example)."

        "On the plane:",
        "The banning of nuts or other allergens on flights has been shown now not to be needed, and so airlines do not have to do this. You should wipe down your area on the plane (eg seat, tray) with wet, detergent wipes that you have brought with you. Some airlines may let you board early to do this, but you can also do it when boarding normally (just don\u2019t forget to pack the wipes in your hand luggage!). Avoid using pillows and blankets given to you on the plane for long-haul flights, as they are often not washed between flights, only rewrapped.",
        "You always need to carry your antihistamine and two adrenaline pens at all times, and this includes when flying. These need to be in your hand luggage (not bags you check in) so that you have them on the plane if you need them. Even if you have extra adrenaline pens, you still should have them in your hand luggage, because the belly of the plane where the checked bags go is too cold for the adrenaline and can damage it. To make sure you don\u2019t have issues bringing these through on board, have a copy of your prescription (your pharmacist will have it on file) and leave the sticker from the pharmacist on the medication box that your adrenaline comes in, as this will have your name on it. You could instead bring a doctor\u2019s letter explaining that you need these medications with you. Sometimes you may not be asked to show anything, but don\u2019t rely on this as the next time you might not be so lucky!",
        "Be really careful when eating on planes. Avoid eating plane food where possible. If going on a long-haul flight, check does your airline offer allergen-free meals, and organise this in advance. Another high-risk scenario is buying something in the airport when you are in a rush or stressed (and maybe not as careful as you would normally be!) and then eating it before boarding or on the plane. Remember that you can have an allergic reaction within about 2 hours of eating your allergen, and so any food you eat before boarding is also important to be really careful with. It is safest to bring your own food/ snacks from home that you are sure are safe for the flight. Check the allergy policy of the airline you are flying with in advance.",
        "You\u2019ve landed safely! Now what?",
        "Be aware that food labelling laws and practices can be different if you are travelling outside the European Union (EU). While most countries in the world do have food labelling laws including allergen labelling, some countries do not yet have laws developed, for example some countries in South America and South Asia. Before travelling to a country, part of your preparation should be to check about their food labelling laws, so that you can be confident when choosing food to eat. Of the majority of countries that do have food labelling laws, they may be different to what you are used to here in Ireland.",
        "If you are travelling to a country where you don\u2019t speak the language, you need to be extra careful that what you say doesn\u2019t get lost in translation! It\u2019s a good idea to have some cards with phrases that explain your allergies in the local language. You can buy personalised ones in many languages on the website \u2018Allergy UK\u2019 \u2013 plastic translation cards.",
        "Pack some safe snacks that are in packets (so they don\u2019t go off) to have with you so that if you are ever unsure due to language difficulties, at least you won\u2019t be too hungry until you can get food  you are confident in.",
        "Make sure you have travel insurance, ask your parents about it! This is a good idea for everyone, and is typically not too expensive. This means if you did need to attend hospital while travelling, you won\u2019t have unexpected expensive hospital bills to pay! If you\u2019re travelling without your parents, have the details (eg company, policy number) written down and saved in your phone. It would also be smart to look in advance to find out where the nearest hospital is and what number to ring to contact emergency services like an ambulance in the country you\u2019re visiting.",
        "As adrenaline is meant to be kept at about room temperature, very hot or very cold temperatures can damage the medication. This isn\u2019t normally a problem in Ireland, but something to think about if you are travelling to somewhere with an extreme climate. Your adrenaline pens would then need to be kept in an insulated case. In a hot climate, keep your pens in the shade out of the heat, or closer to your body in cold climates, like in the inside pocket of your jacket if skiing."

        "Even if you\u2019ve eaten a food product before, you should still check the label each time because sometimes recipes can change without warning. If a food comes in a multipack (for example a 5-pack of chocolate bars), the ingredients list may only be on the outer wrapper.",

        "However, many people with certain food allergies report that it can be difficult to choose foods that don\u2019t have any precautionary allergen statements for their allergen.

        "Even if you have had the same product before, that doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t have a problem with it in the future. This is because there could have been contamination of a certain batch and not others. Also, co-factors affect how our body\u2019s tolerance is on different days (see section on co-factors). Each time you eat the product with the precautionary allergen labelling you should be aware that it is a risk.",
        "Rather than eating the whole product, you might eat a small amount and wait to see how you feel before consuming the rest.",
        "You are taking a known risk, and so if you feel any possible symptoms of an allergic reaction within two hours of eating the product, you need to assume there was your allergen in the food and treat yourself as per your allergy action plan, even if you\u2019re not sure.",
        "Eating in restaurants:",
        "It can be a bit trickier to decide if food is safe for you that doesn\u2019t come in a packet with a label.

        "Some families choose not to keep the food your allergic to in the house, especially with young children. But this is not actually necessary for you. As long as you take proper care, it is fine to have your allergens eaten by other people in the house. Even if your family has chosen to avoid having your allergen at home all along, it is not something you can enforce in the rest of the world and so you need to learn how to manage allergens in your environment safely.",
        "The main risk is from cross-contact. This means when allergens are moved from one food or surface to another. For example, if you use a knife to cut a cheese sandwich, and then use the same knife to cut a ham sandwich, traces of cheese could get onto the ham sandwich.",
        "So what can I do to reduce cross-contact?",
        "You can remove allergen traces with by cleaning surfaces and crockery with soap and warm water and rinsing after, or by cleaning with detergent wipes. Wiping away mess with no cleaning agent (eg some dry paper towel) will not work. \u2018Sanitisers\u2019 like alcohol gel also don\u2019t work to remove the allergen. Make sure your equipment is clean before you start preparing food.",

If they can\u2019t accommodate your needs or they don\u2019t seem to fully understand, you can always bring something that you have prepared.

This causes your immune system to release large amounts of chemicals that cause inflammation, like histamine (see \u2018what are food allergies\u2019 section). This can cause blood vessels to get wider which can let fluid leak from your blood vessels go to places it shouldn\u2019t normally, which can cause;",

        "It's important to remember that from when you take the medicine, it takes about 20-30 minutes to start working in your body, because it needs to be absorbed from your stomach first. If you vomit in this time after taking your antihistamine, you can take it again because your body wouldn\u2019t have absorbed it properly.",

You could use something like a cushion, jumper or bag to lift your legs. This position allows your blood to get to the most important places like your heart and head, and helps keep your blood pressure strong. If your chest feels tight, or your breathing is hard, you might feel better sitting forward. This is okay, but you should not stand up as this can make the reaction worse! Rather than going to get your adrenaline pens, lie down and ask somebody to bring your bag to you.",

If at the 5-minute point after the first dose of adrenaline you feel better, but after that you start to feel worse again, you should also use your second adrenaline pen in this case.",
        "When you get in the ambulance/ at the hospital, you will be connected with wires to machines that check your heart rate, oxygen levels and blood pressure. You might have an oxygen mask over your nose and mouth for a while. If one dose of adrenaline was all you needed, you will just have to stay and be monitored for a few hours, and then you can go home. If the anaphylaxis was more severe, you will be in the right place to get any other medicines or treatment you might need. In this case, you would stay the night in hospital.",

        "Adrenaline really is the magic medicine for anaphylaxis! It counteracts or works against all the different problems that anaphylaxis causes in the body.",
        "Adrenaline helps stop more histamine and other chemicals involved in anaphylaxis from being released by the body.",
        "Adrenaline tightens up blood vessels that had gotten wide and leaky. This helps with any swelling (like in your throat) and helps your blood pressure get back to normal so you don\u2019t feel as faint or weak. Adrenaline also helps your heart beat faster and stronger which also helps your blood pressure.",
        "Adrenaline also widens the small tubes in your lungs, so you can breathe easier again.",
        "Adrenaline helps relax the muscles in your intestines, which helps with tummy pain.",
        "This is how adrenaline treats anaphylaxis so well!",
        "Adrenaline works best the quicker it\u2019s given. It\u2019s much easier to fix a small problem, rather than delaying and then trying to fix a much bigger problem! A common mistake in anaphylaxis is waiting too long to give adrenaline. Dying from anaphylaxis is really very rare \u2013 when it does happen, it\u2019s because adrenaline wasn\u2019t used or it was used too late. The message is that if you follow your allergy action plan and use adrenaline, anaphylaxis is manageable and you will be fine.",
        "Adrenaline is a really safe medicine and so even if you\u2019re not sure if your reaction is mild to moderate or severe, you should use your adrenaline anyway. If your wrong, it won\u2019t do you any harm, and if your right, you will have prevented the reaction getting worse. No one will be cross with you if you use adrenaline pens when you\u2019re not sure. As the saying goes, it\u2019s better to be safe than sorry!",
        "Sometimes people can feel side effects of adrenaline. These include things like feeling like your heart is racing or pounding or feeling shaky. If these happen, they will pass quickly, as adrenaline wears off fast. They won\u2019t do you or your heart any damage.",
        "How do I give adrenaline?",
        "Adrenaline comes in three different brands in Ireland; Epipen, Jext and Anapen.",
        "Over the years, you might have had different ones or you may have had the same type always. Lots of the steps are the same, but some are different for each brand. Be sure to remind yourself of the correct technique of the brand you have each time you get new pens. Epipen, Jext and Anapen all have their own website including short videos on how to use them. Remember that each pen only contains one dose of adrenaline."

      "content": [
        "Take your adrenaline pen out of its case",
        "Hold it like a fist in your dominant hand (the one you write with)",
        "Epipen: take off the blue cap with your other hand (blue to the sky, orange to the thigh)",
        "Jext: take off the yellow cap with your other hand",
        "Anapen: take off the black needle shield by pulling in the direction of the arrow with your other hand. This also removes a grey protective needle shield. Then from the other end of the pen, take off the grey cap from the red firing button",
        "*for all brands, the injection won\u2019t work if the cap hasn\u2019t been taken off.",
        "Prepare where the adrenaline will go. It\u2019s always given into your thigh muscle as this is the biggest muscle you have and so will be absorbed into your body fastest. It\u2019s easiest to quickly pull down your pants (you can leave on your underwear). If you want to give it through your clothes you can, but make sure not to go through a pocket or a seam on your pants, as the material here is thicker and the needle might not go into your muscle like it\u2019s supposed to. You want to give the adrenaline roughly in the middle third of your thigh, to the middle or outer side.",
        "Epipen: hold the pen about 10cm away with the orange end pointing at your thigh, then jab the pen into your thigh at a right angle. You should feel or hear a click. There is no button to press.",
        "Jext: hold the black end against your thigh, then push the pen firmly until you feel or hear a click. There is no button to press.",
        "Anapen: hold the open end (with the pointing black arrow) against your thigh. Then press the red firing button with your thumb so it clicks.",
        "Don\u2019t move your leg and hold the pen in position while you count to 10 slowly. This allows time for all the medicine to get into your muscle.",
        "Take the pen away from your leg.",
        "Epipen: the orange part will stick out by itself and cover the needle",
        "Jext: the black part will stick out by itself and cover the needle",
        "Anapen: The needle is exposed after use and so you need to cover it. Place the wide end of the black needle shield you took off in step 3 on the needle end of the pen and click it on.",
        "Massage your thigh where you gave the injection for 10 seconds. This helps the adrenaline to get absorbed quickly.",
        "Trainer pens are a handy way to practice or show your friends/ teachers. These are fake pens that look like the real thing, but don\u2019t have any needle or medicine in them. Epipen and Jext will send you trainer pens for free if you apply on their website.",
        "How do I store adrenaline?",
        "Your adrenaline pens should be stored at room temperature. Adrenaline can lose its\u2019 effectiveness if kept in extreme heat or cold. They should never be put in the fridge or freezer.",
        "Don\u2019t leave them in the car glove box \u2013 that is no use to you if you have reaction because it takes too long for someone to get them. Also, at night, the temperature of the car gets too cold \u2013 think of the frost that can be on the car windows on winter mornings \u2013 it\u2019s like a fridge! In summer, the glass of the windows makes the car temperature too high.",
        "If travelling to a country with a hot or cold climate, keep your pens in an insulated case and in the shade out of the heat, or closer to your body in cold climates, like in the inside pocket of your jacket if skiing.",
        "Is there a difference between adrenaline and epinephrine?",
        "In most of the world, including Ireland and the rest of Europe, we call the medicine that you inject into your leg for anaphylaxis \u2018adrenaline\u2019. In some parts of the world, including America, they call it \u2018epinephrine\u2019. This is the same medicine! So if you ever are in America, or are reading for example an American website or book, don\u2019t be confused by the term \u2018epinephrine\u2019. It means the same thing."

        "\u2018Neffy\u2019 is the name of a product that should be available in the next few years. Its adrenaline that can be given \u2018intra-nasally\u2019, or as a spray into your nose, instead of an injection into your leg. This is an example of exciting things coming down the line that should make your life with food allergies easier!"

      "heading": "Asthma:",
      "content": [
        "Many people who have food allergies also have asthma \u2013 remember they are both \u2018atopic\u2019 conditions. Having asthma that is \u2018poorly-controlled\u2019 or flared makes it more likely that if you accidently eat your allergen, you can have a more severe reaction.",
        "This is an extra reason why it\u2019s really important to remember to take any medicines or inhalers that you were prescribed in the right way \u2013 using a spacer device. Medicines or inhalers that are for every day can take a while to work, and so keep at it! These don\u2019t work if you only take them sometimes. As well as reducing your risk of a more severe anaphylaxis if you accidently had your allergen, keeping your asthma under control also will give you more freedom in everyday life, like being better able to keep up with your friends and perform better at sport!",
        "If you do have an anaphylaxis reaction and you feel any problem with your breathing, after you use your adrenaline pen you should also use your reliever inhaler. It\u2019s a good idea to carry your reliever inhaler with you everywhere you go, with your antihistamine and your two adrenaline pens."
